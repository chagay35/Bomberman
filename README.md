# Bomberman
My lame version to the popular game.
I wrote this as final project for course OOP 1 in 2nd year preaty much by myself.
Although a lot help from Asher Fisher and Eli Eytan i couldn't implement guards that pursuit the player, so they're just mooving randomly.
Also you can't use bombs, or removig rocks, or open presents, and there is no good animation.
